### Installing Python

Access the following link and download the LTS version

```
    https://www.python.org/downloads/
```

After that, just double-click on the file that was downloaded and install Python by clicking next until it is installed. Run the following command in a terminal (cmd, gitbash or others) to check the version:

```
    python --version
```

### Installing Pipenv

```
    pip install pipenv
```

```
    pipenv --version
```

### Installing Docker

The first step is to set up Docker. For each operating system, you need to follow a step-by-step process:

- Linux

```
               https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/
```

- Windows (WSL installation and configuration are required)

```
               https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/
```

- macOS

```
               https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/
```

### Installing the Container for the Project

To install the container that will run in the project, you need to enter the following command in the terminal:

```
docker run --name postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypassword -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
```

#### In this step, install a DBMS and connect with docker credentials

## ‚öôÔ∏è CONFIGURING THE PROJECT

### Adding Database Connection Values to .config.toml

Connect to the database created with the variables you used to create the Docker image.
Create a file called "config.toml" at the root of the project and add the variables contained in the "example.config.toml" file with the value of the database connection URL(postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/database_name). The ".config.toml" file, according to the container you created, would look something like this:

```
DATABASE_URI=postgres://postgres:mypassword@localhost:5432/chameleon
```

The SECRET_KEY can be generated in this link: https://djecrety.ir

pipenv install 
```
